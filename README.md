👤 Real-Time Face Detection using Viola–Jones Algorithm

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using the Viola–Jones algorithm, implemented with Haar cascade classifiers in OpenCV. The algorithm efficiently detects frontal human faces and is widely used in surveillance, biometrics, and real-time recognition systems.
