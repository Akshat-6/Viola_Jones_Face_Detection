# Viola_Jones_Face_Detection

Real-time face detection using the Viola–Jones algorithm with Haar cascade classifiers implemented in OpenCV.


👤 Real-Time Face Detection using Viola–Jones Algorithm

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using the Viola–Jones algorithm, implemented with Haar cascade classifiers in OpenCV. The algorithm efficiently detects frontal human faces and is widely used in surveillance, biometrics, and real-time recognition systems.

🎯 Objective


To apply the Viola–Jones object detection framework to detect human faces from static images and real-time webcam input using OpenCV’s built-in Haar cascades.

🛠️ What is Viola–Jones?

The Viola–Jones algorithm is a robust, real-time object detection technique that combines:
